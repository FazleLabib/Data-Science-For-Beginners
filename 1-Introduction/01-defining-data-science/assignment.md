# Assignment: Data Science Scenarios

In this first assignment, we ask you to think about some real-life process or problem in different problem domains, and how you can improve it using the Data Science process. Think about the following:

1. Which data can you collect?
1. How would you collect it?
1. How would you store the data? How large the data is likely to be?
1. Which insights you might be able to get from this data? Which decisions we would be able to take based on the data?

Try to think about 3 different problems/processes and describe each of the points above for each problem domain.

Here are some of the problem domains and problems that can get you started thinking:

1. How can you use data to improve education process for children in schools?
1. How can you use data to control vaccination during the pandemic?
1. How can you use data to make sure you are being productive at work?
## Instructions

Fill in the following table (substitute suggested problem domains for your own ones if needed):

| Problem Domain | Problem | Which data to collect | How to store the data | Which insights/decisions we can make | 
|----------------|---------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Education | Monitoring student performance and engagement in online learning platforms. | Student login/logout times, Time spent on each learning module, Quiz scores, Interaction with course materials (e.g., watching videos, reading texts) | Use a database to store student profiles and their activity logs. | Identify students who are struggling or disengaged based on their activity patterns, Optimize course content and delivery based on which materials are most engaging or effective, Predict student outcomes and intervene early to prevent dropout. |
| Vaccination | Tracking vaccination rates and efficacy in a population. | Number of vaccinated individuals, Demographic information (age, gender, location), Type of vaccine received, Date of vaccination | Utilize centralized databases maintained by health authorities or governments. | Monitor vaccination coverage across different demographics and regions, Assess the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns, Identify areas or demographics with low vaccination rates for targeted interventions. |
| Productivity | Optimizing employee productivity and workflow efficiency. | Time spent on different tasks or projects, Number of tasks completed, Project deadlines and milestones, Employee feedback and satisfaction surveys | Implement time tracking tools and project management software, Store feedback data in HR systems or dedicated employee feedback platforms. | Identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies in workflows, Allocate resources more effectively based on workload and productivity trends, Improve employee satisfaction and retention by addressing pain points identified through feedback. |

## Rubric

Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement
--- | --- | -- |
One was able to identify reasonable data sources, ways of storing data and possible decisions/insights for all problem domains | Some of the aspects of the solution are not detailed, data storage is not discussed, at least 2 problem domains are described | Only parts of the data solution are described, only one problem domain is considered.
